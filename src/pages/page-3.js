    <p>If there is one thing I'm good at doing, it's building relationships within the team. We all met on Monday with a warm greeting. After our introductions, we stated what we enjoyed the most about development and our hobbies. Thankfully there were no immediate headbutts in personality, so I'd say this team with pretty compatable.</p>
    <p>I couldn't help but notice that we all fell into place very quickly once we were allowed to work on the project and everyone seems to be self managed when progressing which is a nice change of pace. This helped by letting me manage my own time more efficiently, giving me more opportunity to work on my PR count for the week.</p>
    <p>There are a few issues in the team's dynamic though. Some members can get a little bullheaded and dissagreements without resolution occure more often than I'd like, but we've managed so far. For example, one team member commented on how Lambda's development cycle was backward compared to everything  he was self taught. Even though we all agreed with him, a couple of members thought it'd be best to go with Lambda's guidelines rather than deviating from it and doing our own thing. This issue was never resolved, and we're making the best of the situation.</p>
    <p>I'd say as a team member in our group I try to lighten the mood while juggling professionalism, but I'm sure I fault on the side of unprofessional. Regardless, I'd say I'm doing more good than harm.</p>
